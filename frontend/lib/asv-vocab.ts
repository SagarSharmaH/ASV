/**
 * The vocabulary ASV can currently recognise, plus the tap-to-speak phrasebook.
 *
 * Two separate things live here on purpose:
 *
 *  - `VOCAB` mirrors the words the EMG model is trained on. A recognised token
 *    is short ("help"), but what gets spoken aloud should sound like a person
 *    ("I need help"), so each entry carries both.
 *  - `PHRASEBOOK` needs no hardware or model at all. It is the fallback that
 *    makes the app useful the moment it is installed — and the thing a user
 *    reaches for when the electrodes are off.
